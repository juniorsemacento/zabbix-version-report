# Zabbix Agent Version Checker

A Python script to retrieve the Zabbix agent version for hosts in a Zabbix server. This tool allows you to check if agents are up-to-date, generating a CSV report of agent versions across specified hosts or host groups.

## Features
- Retrieve Zabbix agent versions from specified host groups.
- Save output to a CSV file with host names, IP addresses, and agent versions.
- Minimize API calls by fetching essential details in a single request.
- Supports API token authentication.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Zabbix server with API access and appropriate permissions
- **Python Packages**:
  - `pyzabbix`
  - `urllib3` (for handling HTTPS warnings)

To install the required packages:
```bash
pip install pyzabbix urllib3
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zabbix-agent-version-checker.git
   cd zabbix-agent-version-checker
   ```

2. Update the `ZABBIX_API_KEY` variable in the script with your Zabbix API key.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python zbxreport.py <zabbix_url> --hostgroup_ids <group_id_1> <group_id_2>
   ```

   - `<zabbix_url>`: The base URL of your Zabbix server, e.g., `https://your-zabbix-server.com`.
   - `--hostgroup_ids` (optional): Space-separated list of host group IDs. If omitted, it will check all hosts.

   Example:
   ```bash
   python zbxreport.py https://example-zabbix.com --hostgroup_ids 2 3
   ```

4. The output CSV file, `ReportZabbixVersion.csv`, will be created in the current directory.

## Configuration
To use this script:
- Ensure you have a valid API key with permissions to access hosts and read items.
- Set `ZABBIX_API_KEY` in the script to your API token.
  
If you prefer to verify SSL, comment out the `zapi.session.verify = False` line in the script.
